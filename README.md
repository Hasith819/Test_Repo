# PlayHub iOS Game App

## Architecture Overview

PlayHub is a SwiftUI based iOS application that contains multiple mini games. 
The app is developed using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern.

The project is divided into different folders to keep the code clean and organized.

### App
The App folder contains the main application files. 
`PlayHubApp.swift` is the starting point of the application and loads the main tab navigation. 
`AppTabShellView.swift` manages the four main tabs of the app.

### Models
The Models folder contains the data structures used in the application.

- `GameSession` stores completed game details such as game type, score, date, and location.
- `LocationGroup` is used to group game sessions by location.
- `TriviaQuestion` contains the quiz question data received from the API.

### Views
The Views folder contains all user interface screens.

There are two main sections:

**Games**
- Tap Frenzy
- Light It Up
- Quiz Rush
- Game Over screen

**Tabs**
- Home
- Stats
- Map
- Settings

Views are responsible only for displaying information and handling user interaction.

### ViewModels
ViewModels contain the main logic of the application.

Each game has its own ViewModel:

- `TapFrenzyVM` controls the tapping game logic.
- `LightItUpVM` controls card levels, timer, and scoring.
- `QuizRushVM` manages questions, answers, timer, and scoring.

Other ViewModels:

- `HomeVM` manages daily challenges.
- `StatsVM` calculates game statistics.
- `MapVM` manages map data.
- `SettingsVM` handles notifications and resetting data.

### Services
Services handle external functions and data management.

- `GameSessionStore` saves and loads game history using UserDefaults.
- `LocationService` gets the current user location.
- `NotificationService` creates daily challenge reminders.
- `TriviaApiService` connects with Open Trivia API to get quiz questions.

### Shared Components
The Shared folder contains reusable UI components.

- `GameBackground` provides an animated background for games.
- `MenuBackground` provides the background design for menu screens.

# Known Limitations

- The application stores data only on the local device. Data cannot be synchronized between multiple devices.
- Map locations depend on GPS accuracy and internet availability.
- Quiz questions depend on the Open Trivia API, so questions cannot load if the API is unavailable.
- The application currently supports only the included three games.
- No user account system is available.
- Notifications depend on user permission.
- Some UI designs may need more improvements for different screen sizes.

# Reflection

Developing PlayHub helped me improve my SwiftUI and iOS development skills.

I learned how to use the MVVM architecture to separate UI and business logic. This made the project easier to manage and understand.

During this project, I learned how to work with:
- SwiftUI views
- ViewModels and ObservableObject
- Local data storage using UserDefaults
- Location services using Core Location
- Apple MapKit
- Notifications
- External APIs and JSON data

The most challenging parts were creating game logic, managing timers, saving game sessions, and connecting external services.

Through this project, I improved my problem-solving skills and learned how to structure a real iOS application properly.

In the future, I would like to improve this app by adding user accounts, online score sharing, more games, and cloud data storage.
